# Cast of Characters
> Collectively, characters should fill various of Joseph Campbell's archetypes, act on the theme's problem in different ways, fill various roles outlined by genre conventions, and balance order and chaos.
> Individually, they must act on personal goals and human needs, show unexpected yet realistic characteristics (maybe carry a symbol, respond unexpectedly, defy stereotypes, have strange habits, have delusional self-perception), have a bold introduction (characteristic action or dialog), be likeable (displaying morality, suffering, or strength), and evolve in dealing with conflict (be haunted by it, then be faced by it in new urgency, and fearing the future)

# Plot Twist
> With the natural story conclusion, list assumptions the audience may be employing in order to believe in it, then explore how the assumptions could be violated

The natural conclusion has the artist's son reveal all in the town square, drying up the supply of mass-produced artwork, paving the way for an equal society.

In a twist, the activist, while carrying the machine, chances upon the artist's son lying injured and trapped, and destroys the machine in saving the artist's son.
# Foreshadowing
> Objects or non-tangible things, emotions, changes in behaviour, or possession of unexpected knowledge, or the absence or reversal of any of those things, which hint at connections between characters and events


# Easter Eggs
1. Damaged ship poorly-buried near the palace
2. Palace work room features the Artist's old well-preserved bible
3. Homage to games that inspired this one
