# Elevator Pitch
An island community has a big class divide, with the upper class sharing a love of artwork produced by a single artist. The artist employs the lower class but is a fraud, creating work with a stolen machine and passing it as his own. His reputation and income are challenged by a choice between continuing that life or throwing it away in the name of honesty and integrity.
# Themes
- Is it a meaningful life to consume compulsively and never produce?
- Is it a meaningful life to outsource the work and sell it as your own?
- How much intrinsic value is there in something that is uniquely "human"?
# Evocative Questions
1. How did the community become isolated?
2. Why is nobody else pursuing that market?
3. How is the son protecting their secrets?
4. Does the son desire companionship or romance?
5. How would the community feel if they found out the secrets?
6. What type of person or creature would be okay with the way things are?
7. How would those who impulsively consume art react to the supply drying up?
# Reactive Events
1. ✅ An outsider comes bringing exciting new artwork; the son would feel threatened
2. ✅ Somebody has tried to create their own arts; they found tools are not readily available and they aren't finding themselves to be very marketable
3. ✅ The son is surrounded by people who were homeless until they were taken in and have nowhere else to go, so sign a deal to protect secrets at all costs
4. ✅ In isolation, the son has always been lonely, but never had a love interest; he comes to admire the activist's moral integrity and begins to see a better life
5. Word at one point starts to spread that the son doesn't create his own artwork but keeps a secret; the spreader of this rumour is identified as a homeless one who struggles for food and is adopted under promise of a comfortable life at last
6. ✅ Beavers are builders, and hence practical and logical thinkers; they aren't naturally inclined to be artistic
7. ✅ The supply of art will dry up; those attached to the consumption will continue to inflate their egos by over-valuing their possessions and trying to sell
# Society
## World
Location: An isolated island with nothing around
Culture: Beavers living in (mostly) paradise, badgers and birds the other prominent occupants
Features:
- A labyrinth of amazing rivers covers much of the island, making it a beaver's paradise
- Landscape filled with jungle trees and 
- Surrounding the island, a murky haze obscures the outside world in mystery
## The Art Palace
Location: Atop a cliff at the edge of the island, with one path up, visible on the horizon from almost any part of the island
Culture: Staff stand obediently in their positions as the Artist's Son works alone
Features:
- Palace of humble structure but other-worldly material
- Single narrow path the only access, safeguarded by a mechanical gate and palace staff
- Main work room, decorated with artwork, separated from the outside by a long lobby hall
- A hidden prison with people who arrived on the island allegedly to conquer
## Homeless Valley
Location: Adjacent to the Art Palace, lower ground than anywhere else
Culture: Residents looking similar to palace staff, but labouring all day struggling to keep up, became down on luck (lost money on badger races, or lost family) and hopeful for a better life
Features:
- Desolate landscape with uncomfortable shacks and a mass of broken constructions
- Broken monument to the Artist
- Muddy, shallow puddles everywhere, no significant waterways or food sources
## Main Community
Location: Across the valley from the palace
Culture: Down-to-earth and respectful, valuing hard work to keep the economy running
Features:
- Well-made, intricately-detailed wooden shacks
- Pristine waterways, plentiful willows, pond lilies, and general vegetation
- Badger racetrack being a source of entertainment
## The Aristocracy
Location: On the edge of the main community, atop a cliff with complex staircase winding upward
Culture: Like-minded individuals, see others' value based on possessions not on their handiwork, egotistical and comfortably wealthy
Features:
- Polished monument to the Artist
- A maze of treetop boardwalks makes travel there difficult
