# Elevator Pitch
A community isolated from the rest of the world lose their sole artist whose works have become universally appreciated, and now their son, devoid of talent, has stolen a machine that creates random derivatives of existing artworks. The son's reputation and income are challenged by a choice between continuing that life or pursuing a love interest.
# Evocative Questions
1. How did the community become isolated?
2. Why is nobody else pursuing that market?
3. How is the son protecting their secrets?
4. Has the son long had a desire to chase love?
5. How would the community feel if they found out the secrets?
6. What type of person or creature would be okay with the way things are?
7. How would those who impulsively consume art react to the supply drying up?
# Reactive Events
1. An outsider comes bringing exciting new artwork; the son would feel threatened
2. Somebody has tried to create their own arts; they found tools are not readily available and they aren't finding themselves to be very marketable
3. The son is surrounded by people who were homeless until they were taken in and have nowhere else to go, so sign a deal to protect secrets at all costs, but then a love interest is sceptical and desperate to uncover truths; the servant who let them in is fired, but later excused after the son falls for the sceptic
4. In isolation, the son has always been lonely and recognised that, but never had a love interest; he comes to admire the sceptic's moral integrity and begins to see a better life
5. Word at one point starts to spread that the son doesn't create his own artwork but keeps a secret; the spreader of this rumour is identified as a homeless one who struggles for food and is adopted under promise of a comfortable life at last
6. Beavers are builders, and hence practical and logical thinkers; they aren't naturally inclined to be artistic
7. The supply of art will dry up; those attached to the consumption will continue to inflate their egos by over-valuing their possessions and trying to sell
# Physical World
Across an island covered by a labyrinth of amazing rivers, the beaver community has dominated lands for millennia. With oceans far too expansive to cross, nobody dares venture away, and no outsiders are expected to arrive, besides the fish and the birds who need no grounding.
A makeshift prison houses people who arrived by sea, allegedly to conquer and prepare the land for their own invasion. Their vessel is poorly-buried on a beach in an off-limits (secret) area, and is advised to be poorly-constructed, irreparable, and of no interest to the beavers.
Beavers live in wooden shacks which dot their village. Atop a high cliff, a particularly robust yet ornate structure, built of foreign materials, houses the artist's son, with an iron makeshift (of unconventional construction) gate blocking passage across the narrow walkway which leads up to the top. Around this cliff is a rough swamp with little to be desired for beavers: no good logs, puddles too shallow to inhabit safely, and devoid of anything edible.
Sections of the island are covered by shacks, other parts go deep into caves, others follow wooden obstacle courses into treetop economies, and others follow the contours of rock faces.
# Culture
Communities are built around centres of comfort: shelter, good wood for building, and good food sources like thick shrubs, willows, and pond lilies. Economies thrive on sale of these commodities.
Hedgehogs roam the island, but are seen as lower creatures and are a source of entertainment.
There is a problem with homelessness, as beavers find themselves in hard times due to either loss of family members or losing all their money at the hedgehog races. It is fairly well-known that beavers on hard times are often taken in by the artist's son, who seems to employ nobody of more privileged background and hence has a reputation for helping those most in need.
The more privileged in the community bolster their egos purchasing unique artwork, though none of them possess a desire to produce artwork themselves, as it's not seen as a privileged thing to do. The beavers in a position of less privilege find more labour-intensive occupations, as artist is a volatile career nobody can afford to risk.
# Themes
- Is it a meaningful life to consume compulsively and never produce?
- Is it a meaningful life to outsource the work and sell it as your own?
- How much intrinsic value is there in something that is uniquely "human"?
