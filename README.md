# Graph Runner

This is a showcase demo for the MIDI Graph Bevy integration.

Audio is an easy-to-overlook piece of a larger game design composition, making a huge
difference to atmosphere and feeling when supported by other elements such as graphics
and gameplay. This game aims to show what the MIDI Graph crate can do within a platform
game built using the Bevy game engine.

## Story

This game tells the story of an adventure with a clear goal transforming as a subquest
takes over unexpectedly.

The phases of the game are:
- Peace in freedom from responsibility; take time to play around without purpose
- Call to adventure; energy from acquiring a clear, attainable goal
- Confidence; joy of making progress
- Twist; unexpected subquest arises with unclear goals
- Tension from unfulfilled goals while other things take over
- Relief as the subquest is completed
- Twist; the main path has an unclear finish line
- Triumph as the finish line is reached
- Relief once again
